# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

project brandy garfield

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

a choose your own adventure games filled with twists and turns

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

So I am thinking that I will prompt the user with different choices that will lead to two different endings. Each choice should project an image using ai or renpy

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

NONE

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

NONE
## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

An enjoyable experience for the user and hopefully something that resoanates with the professor and the world

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
It will extremely be in long depth and professor will exempt me from final exam:))

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I become a developer immediately after making this.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to outline a general plot. Need to figure out the choices and setting and how they will affect the overall story. I think the new skill I will need to acquire is implementing a program that allows ai generated art to be created everytime the user uses it.
I need to research everything and all in all its like coming full circle.
